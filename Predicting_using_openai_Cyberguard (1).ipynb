Afterward, my phone started freezing, and it wasn’t normal. I thought it was a technical glitch, but now I’m not so sure. I don't know how, but it’s like they knew everything I was doing, even though I was trying to be careful. It’s terrifying to think about. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My work account was hackd, and then I got locked out of everything. This has really left me anxious and frustrated, I can’t sleep knowing my information is out there. I’ve even considered deleting all my accounts, but that’s not a solution. Even my phone isn’t working right anymore. It’s so stange how everything just fell apart after that one email.\""
